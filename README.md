Introduction: 

Vanar Balak Game is a game of addition battle where Vanar Balak and Dushman (computer) engage in a fierce battle to dominate the numbers from the void. 
Whoever can score the maximum number will win the battle. 

Game Instructions : 1. You are Vanar Balak and you need to win against dushman! You win by getting the highest possible number in a set composed of 10 rounds.
                    2. A random number is generated from the void in each round and you can either keep it or give it to dushman and the next round turn will belong to dushman.
                    3. A new number from the void, Dushman in their turn can also keep or give the number in that round to you.
                    4. Your numbers will add up in your score and dushman's in their score.
                    5. Also, both parties can keep only 5 numbers with themselves. That means if you have 5 numbers added up already in this set,
                    Then you cannot take the number in your round and Dusham cannot give you the number in his round.
                    6. The one to score the maximum number will win the set.
                    
                    -> 1 Set = 10 Rounds
